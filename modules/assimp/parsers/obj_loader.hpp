/**	\file	obj_loader.hpp
 *  \author	Rob Bateman [mailto:robthebloke@hotmail.com] [http://robthebloke.org]
 *  \date	11-4-05
 *  \brief	A C++ loader for the alias wavefront obj file format.
 *
 * This loader is intended to be as complete as possible
 * (ie, it handles everything that Maya can spit at it,
 * as well as all the parametric curve and surface stuff not supported
 * by Maya's objexport plugin).
 *
 * If you want to add obj import/export capabilities to your applications,
 * the best method is probably to derive a class from Obj::File and then
 * use the data in the arrays provided (or fill the data arrays with the
 * correct info, then export).
 *
 * Generally speaking, the obj file format is actually very very complex.
 * As a result, not all of the Curve and Surface types are fully supported
 * in the openGL display parts of this code. Bezier, Bspline & NURBS curves
 * and surface should be fine. Cardinal, taylor and basis matrix types
 * will be displayed as CV's / HULLS only. Trim curves and holes don't get
 * displayed either. I'll leave that as an excersice for the reader.
 * The material lib files (*.mtl) are also supported and parsed, this
 * includes a user extensible interface to load the image files as textures.
 * See the texture manager example for more info.
 *
 * One nice aspect of this code is the ability to calculate normals for
 * the polygonal surfaces, and the ability to convert the objfile into
 * surfaces and /or vertex arrays. Hopefully it may be useful to someone.
 *
 * If you wish to use this code within a game, I **STRONGLY** RECOMMEND
 * converting the data to Vertex Arrays and saving as your own custom
 * file format. The code to handle your own objects will be substantially
 * more efficient than this code which is designed for completeness, not
 * speed! See the obj->game converter for a quick example of this.

/** @class Obj_File
    @brief main interface for an alias wavefront obj file.

    Note on the data structure :
    The provided list of data  (i.e : _vertices, _VertexParams, _normals,
    _texCoords, _points, _lines, _triangles, _groups, _mat_groups etc.)
    respect the .obj file layout. There is no garante that a list
    reference all the elements of another list.

    In other words : _triangles does not necessarily points to every vertices
    indices if there are lonely vertices. Another example : some groups don't
    have materials. this often means the material of the previous group should
    be used. We don't make that asumption and leave it at the user discretion,
    thus some group's material are empty.

    for faces without groups we make an exception and create  default group
    with name "" in order to reference every faces.

    _triangles layout is the same as the obj layout. Material groups are not
    necessarily contigus in _triangles. Therefore when rendering, doing a loop
    over the material groups doesn't garantee to be efficient as one material
    might be activated and desactivated several time.
