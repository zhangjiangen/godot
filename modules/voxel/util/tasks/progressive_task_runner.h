// TODO It would be really nice if Godot4 Vulkan buffer deallocation was better optimized.

// It happens on the main thread and causes deferred stutters when a terrain contains a lot of chunks
// and the camera moves fast.
// I hate this workaround because it feels like we are almost not in control of a stable framerate.
// "Make less meshes" is not enough, if it can't be dynamically adressed.

// This can be used in place of a time-slicing runner when the duration of tasks cannot be used as a cost metric.
// This is the case of tasks that defer their workload to another system to run later. It is far from perfect though,
// and is a last resort solution when optimization and threading are not possible.
// Such tasks may preferably not require low latency in the game,
// because they will likely run a bit later than a time-sliced task.
